 Few sample queries to demonstrate the working of the database
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Query 1: A simple query of a single table.

- List the ID,name and contact information of all donors whose age is less than 30 years.

 select Donor_ID, Donor_Name, Donor_PhoneNo, Donor_Email, Donor_Age from Donor 
 where Donor_Age < 30
 order by Donor_ID;



Query 2 : A query which uses the words "natural join".

- List Blood banks(Blood bank name, Contact number) and bloodtype of all
blood banks where negative blood type is available.

select Blood_bank_Name, Blood_bank_phoneNo, Blood_type
from BloodBank NATURAL JOIN Blood
where Blood_type LIKE '%-'
order by Blood_bank_Name;


Query 3 : The cross product equivalent to the "natural join" query above.

- Above query using cross product

select Blood_bank_Name, Blood_bank_phoneNo, Blood_type
from BloodBank, Blood
where BloodBank.Blood_bank_ID = Blood.Blood_bank_ID
and Blood_type LIKE '%-'
order by Blood_bank_Name;


Query 4 : A query involving a “Group by”, perhaps also with a “HAVING”.

- List the names of the hospitals with atleast 5 requests in the last month.

select Hospital_Name, count(*) as No_of_requests
from Hospital NATURAL JOIN Request
where Request_Date >= '2022-09-01' and Request_Date < '2022-09-30'
GROUP BY Hospital_Name
Having count(Patient_ID) >= 5
ORDER BY Hospital_Name;


Query 5 : A query which uses a sub query.

- Select the name of the blood banks who are associated with 'First Choice Hospitals'. 

SELECT Blood_bank_name
FROM BloodBank
WHERE Blood_bank_ID IN( SELECT Blood_bank_ID 
                        FROM BloodManager
                        WHERE  Hospital_ID = 
                         (SELECT Hospital_ID
                          FROM Hospital  
                          WHERE Hospital_Name ='First Choice Hospitals'));


Query 6 : A cross product which cannot be implemented using the words “natural join” 

- List the Donors who are from the same age group.

select D1.Donor_ID, D1.Donor_Name,D1.Donor_Age 
from Donor D1, Donor D2
where D1.Donor_ID <> D2.Donor_ID 
and D1.Donor_Age = D2.Donor_Age 
order by D1.Donor_Age, D1.Donor_ID;



Query 7: An example of a view.

CREATE VIEW Camp_Info_NSW AS
	SELECT Camp_ID, Blood_bank_name, Camp_date as Date, Camp_Address as Address
      FROM Campaign NATURAL JOIN BloodBank
      where Camp_Address LIKE '%NSW';
