**Inspiration**

This project was inspired by the challenges faced during my volunteering experience at university blood donation camps. The aim was to develop a system that could efficiently manage donor and campaign data, replacing the outdated practice of using handwritten forms.

**About**

This repository contains a SQL script for creating and managing a Blood Donation Database. 
To create the database, execute the SQL script in a PostgreSQL environment. The script includes commands for creating tables, defining constraints, and inserting sample data.

The Blood Donation Database is designed to store and manage information related to blood donors, donation campaigns, blood banks, hospitals, patients, and blood requests. The database aims to streamline the process of organizing blood donation camps and managing the related data, making it easier to retrieve and handle information as the number of participants grows.

**Key Features**

-Donor Management: Stores personal information of donors, including contact details and blood group.

-Campaign Tracking: Keeps records of blood donation campaigns, including location, date, and associated blood banks.

-Blood Inventory: Manages blood group information and links to the respective blood banks.

-Hospital and Patient Records: Maintains data on hospitals and patients, facilitating blood requests and supply management.

-Data Integrity: Ensures data validity through constraints on fields like phone numbers, email addresses, and blood types.

**ERD Diagram**

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is also provided in the repository to illustrate the database structure and relationships between the tables.

**Sample Query File**

A Sample Query File is included in the repository to demonstrate how the database works. The file contains example queries that show how to retrieve and manipulate data within the Blood Donation Database.

**Future Enhancements**

-Frontend Integration: Develop a user-friendly interface for easier data input and retrieval.

-Reporting Tools: Implement reporting features to generate insights on blood donation trends.

-Expand Database: Include additional tables for more detailed tracking of blood storage and logistics.
